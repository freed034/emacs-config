* Description
This is a repo with my custom configuration for emacs. It works with Linux and macOS.

* Usage
The simple way to use those emacs files is made a symbolic link from the clone folder to your home directory. You can follow the next instructions:

- clone the repository in your local system
  #+begin_src bash
    git clone https://github.com/freed034/emacs-config.git
  #+end_src
  
- create a symbolic link in the local emacs folder inside ~/.config
  #+begin_src bash
    ln -sf "path to the clone folder"/init.el ~/.config/emacs/
  #+end_src
