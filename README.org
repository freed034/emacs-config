* Description
This is a repo with my custom configuration for emacs. It works in Linux and macOS.

* Usage
The simple way to use those emacs files is made the symbolic link *~/.config/emacs/* to the clone folder. You can follow the next instructions:

- clone the repository in your home directory
  #+begin_src bash
    git clone https://github.com/freed034/emacs-config.git ~/Emacs
  #+end_src
  
- make the symbolic link *~/.config/emacs*
  #+begin_src bash
    ln -sf ~/Emacs ~/.config/emacs
  #+end_src
